The source code for the book GWT in Action 2nd Edition comes with maven. 
However, if you do not use maven or do not like to use maven, this project 
is for generating ant build files for the source code.

Note I am not associated with the book in any way. I think it's a great 
book on GWT. I do not use maven, so I wrote this ruby program to generate 
ant build files for my own need. You might fight it useful as well.

There is also a zip files with pre-generated build.xml and supported files.

Please look at the web page for details:
